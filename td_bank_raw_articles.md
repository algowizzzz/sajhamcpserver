> TORONTO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - TD Bank (TD.TO), opens new tab on Thursday warned of a challenging 2025 and suspended its medium-term earnings forecast as Canada's second-biggest lender works through its anti-money laundering remediation program following a U.S. regulatory probe. TD issued its updates after the lender and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO), opens new tab, two of Canada's biggest banks, missed analysts' estimates for quarterly profit, reflecting weakness in their U.S. businesses and bigger-than-anticipated funds to cover potential loan losses. In contrast, the smallest of the country's big five banks - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM.TO), opens new tab - reported a fourth-quarter profit that surpassed estimates, helped by smaller-than-expected loan loss provisions and strength at its Canadian retail arm.

**Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements** This document contains forward-looking statements. All such statements are made pursuant to the "safe harbour" provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "will", "would", "should", "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "intend", "strive", "confident", "estimate", "forecast", "outlook", "plan", "goal", "commit", "target", "possible", "potential", "predict", "project", "may", and "could" and similar expressions or variations thereof, or the negative thereof, but these terms are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond the Bank's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the "Risk Factors and Management" section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis ("2024 MD&A"), as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders, Investor Day presentation materials and news releases (as applicable). All such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, should be considered carefully when making decisions with respect to the Bank. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on the Bank's forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements contained in this document represent the views of management only as of the date hereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank's financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. The Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on its behalf, except as required under applicable securities legislation.

Outlook On Toronto-Dominion Bank Revised To Stable From Positive On Economic Uncertainty; 'AA-' Rating Affirmed

[Overview](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/897273)

*   We are revising the outlook on Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) to stable from positive based on our expectations that a weak Canadian economic recovery will provide more challenging operating conditions than had previously been expected. 
*   TD Bank continues to experience consistent and strong core operating performance from domestic operations with a growing contribution from its U.S. retail bank. 
*   We are affirming our 'AA-/A-1+' counterparty credit ratings on TD Bank and related entities.

TORONTO (Standard & Poor's) Oct. 6, 2011--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services 
today said it revised its outlook on TD Bank to stable from positive on 
reduced expectations that future operating outperformance will provide 
sufficient grounds for an upgrade in the near-to-medium term.  

Standard & Poor's also affirmed its ratings on the bank and related entities, 
including its 'AA-' long-term and 'A-1+' short-term counterparty credit 
ratings.

"The stable outlook incorporates our expectations that TD Bank will exhibit 
stable ongoing operating performance, despite a possibly deteriorating 
economic environment," said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Thomas Connell. 
This expectation is based on TD Bank's leading domestic franchise, with its 
solid track record of top-line growth and operating performance, supported by 
the conservative risk orientation of TD Bank's management and strategy. 
Standard & Poor's believes that TD Bank is well positioned to weather more 
challenging operating conditions while continuing to build its Canadian and 
U.S. retail-oriented financial services franchises. 

Standard & Poor's had revised the outlook to positive in June 2010, with the 
potential for an upgrade linked to TD Bank's continuing strong domestic 
performance, successful integration of recent U.S. acquisitions, and 
sustainable improvement of its U.S. credit portfolio. The bank has continued 
its strong overall performance, and has made progress on integration and 
stabilization of its U.S. acquisitions (while adding further incremental 
acquisitions in the meantime). Despite this progress, current economic and 
market conditions have reduced the potential for an upgrade.

A contraction of Canada's second-quarter GDP (negative 0.4% on an annualized 
basis) points to what may be a bumpy path back to full capacity utilization 
for the Canadian economy. This and other factors have the potential to 
constrain the performance of TD Bank and Canadian peer institutions in various 
ways, including growing pressure on revenue growth and net interest margins 
resulting from competition for loan growth and deposit balances in the face of 
possibly slowing customer demand. 

The combined effect of these factors is to limit the foreseeable upside 
potential of the ratings relative to the bank's current level of 'AA-'.

Nonetheless, Standard & Poor's believes TD Bank is well-positioned at the 
current rating level to achieve solid performance across a range of market 
conditions. Considerations that continue to support TD Bank's credit profile 
include our view of the following factors:

*   A leading domestic retail franchise with leading positions in most business categories and an increasingly distinct retail service orientation;
*   A conservative management orientation and strategy that has led to a reduced emphasis on TD Bank's wholesale banking unit as a source of earnings; and
*   Very solid asset quality that has performed well over the most recent economic cycle, reflecting sound and consistent underwriting and risk management processes, as well as the positive impac

Fitch Ratings - Toronto - 20 May 2025: Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Toronto-Dominion Bank's (TD) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA-' and Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook remains Negative. Fitch has also affirmed the ratings of TD's subsidiaries, TD Bank US Holding Company and TD Bank, N.A.

### Key Rating Drivers

The affirmations reflect TD's resilient financial profile, including consistent and prudent underwriting, benign asset quality, diversified business mix, strong capitalization and robust liquidity.

The Outlook, which was placed following investigations by regulators on the deficiencies of TD's anti-money laundering (AML) practices in the U.S., remains Negative. TD announced that a global settlement was reached on Oct. 10, 2024, including consent orders on its U.S. operations. Therefore, with only one quarter of financial results reported since the bank's year end of Oct. 31, 2024, the full impact on TD's franchise, particularly in the U.S., has yet to be assessed. The announced settlement's monetary penalties and remediation efforts were absorbable in the context of the bank's earnings and strong capital.

**Impact of BSA/AML Probe:** Thus far, there seems to have been limited impact from the AML issues on the bank's core Canadian franchise which is relatively more focused on retail and commercial clients versus peers. In Fitch's opinion, the impact on the U.S. franchise has been contained with little deposit outflows. The bank's consent orders placed an asset cap on TD's two U.S. banking subsidiaries (TD Bank, NA and TD Bank USA, NA) at their Sept. 30, 2024, level of US$434 billion.

TD is repositioning its balance sheet to provide room for organic growth. However, Fitch believes there could be impediments to achieving growth and profitability targets as the U.S. subsidiaries will be subject to more stringent approval processes for new products, services, markets and stores.

**Strategic Review:**With long-time TD executive Raymond Chun taking over as COO (later CEO in February 2025), the bank launched a broad-based strategic review in November 2024 to reassess organic opportunities and priorities, which include optimizing capital allocation among its business segments and simplifying its business structure. Two areas identified by management include exiting lower ROE non-franchise portfolios in U.S. retail and opportunities to grow its investment bank. The potential shift toward corporate and investment banking in the U.

Fitch Ratings-Toronto-11 June 2025: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of the federal domestic systemically important Canadian banks and the Desjardins Group. Additionally, Toronto Dominion Bank’s Rating Outlook remains Negative as Fitch has not yet fully assessed the full impact of anti-money laundering (AML) issues on TD's U.S. franchise.

Fitch affirmed the following:

--Bank of Montreal Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘AA-‘/Stable

--Bank of Nova Scotia Long-Term IDR at ‘AA-’/Stable

--Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Long-Term IDR at ‘AA-‘/Stable

--National Bank of Canada Long-Term IDR at ‘A+’/Stable

--Toronto-Dominion Bank Long-Term IDR at ‘AA-‘/ Negative

--Royal Bank of Canada Long-Term IDR at ‘AA-‘/Stable

--Desjardins Group Long-Term IDR at ‘AA-‘/Stable.

The rating affirmations reflect Fitch’s view that the banks enter this period of economic weakness, caused by tariff uncertainty, from a position of strength in credit fundamentals and financial performance indicators. 

As of Fitch’s most recent Global Economic Outlook, we cut the 2025 and 2026 GDP forecasts for Canada to +0.1% and +0.5%, respectively. This implies a peak-to-trough contraction in GDP of 1.5% this year, which would be a mild recession by past standards. Furthermore, our forecast shows a deterioration in unemployment to 7.5% for both 2025-2026 from 6.4% in 2024, with the expectation of the Bank of Canada rate cutting its overnight rate to 2.00% from the current 2.75%.

Fitch expects asset quality to deteriorate particularly for commercial and corporate loans that are directly impacted by tariffs. For 2Q25 (1Q25 for Desjardins), the gross impaired loans (GIL) ratio averaged 0.82%, up from 0.66% in 2Q24. The ratio will likely approach 1% in 2025, which is manageable for the banks given their strong fundamentals; however, we don’t expect it to breach that level on a sustainable basis. However, if it did, it would cause rating pressures. 

The banks have reported softness in consumer loans, particularly credit cards and unsecured loans through 2024. However, the pace of impaired formations has slowed. Residential mortgage loans continue to perform well given low loan-to-values and the nation-wide housing shortage.

To mitigate tariff risks, banks have increased performing provisions as forward-looking indicators in base-case economic scenarios have worsened. Fitch expects continued provision build through the rest of 2025.

With the economic slowdown and weakening consumer and business sentiment, Fitch expects muted loan and revenue growth. Combined with higher loan loss provisions (LLPs), Canadian banks may report lower profitability for the rest of the year. The elevated trading revenue seen in 1Q25 and 2Q25 is unlikely to be sustained. However, cost control schemes implemented in 2024-2025 have improved efficiency and operating leverage. Fitch notes the banks’ diversified, established business models—a key rating strength—as well as their sturdy fee-based income streams, which will help bolster revenues.

The ratings also reflect the banks’ healthy liquidity and c

Moody's Ratings downgrades the long-term ratings of The Toronto-Dominion Bank and TD Group US Holdings LLC; outlooks changed to stable

Toronto, October 23, 2024 -- Moody's Ratings (Moody's) has today downgraded the long-term ratings and assessments of The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), including its Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) to a2 from a1, its long-term Counterparty Risk Ratings to Aa2 from Aa1 and the bank's long-term Counterparty Risk Assessment to Aa3(cr) from Aa2(cr). Concurrent with this rating action, we downgraded the long-term issuer rating to A3 from A2 of TD Group US Holdings LLC (TD GUS), the US Intermediate Holding Company (IHC) of TD Bank US Holding Company, which in turn is the direct parent of TD Bank, N.A. (collectively, "TD US").

The rating outlooks for the long-term deposits, issuer ratings, senior unsecured and junior senior unsecured debt ratings at TD as well as the outlook for the long-term issuer rating at TD GUS included in today's rating action were changed to stable from negative.

The rating action follows TD's announcement [1] on 10 October that it has resolved its civil and criminal investigations into its US Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/anti-money laundering (AML) program by US prudential regulators, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the US Department of Justice. The total financial penalties of US$3.09 billion was largely covered by the bank's previous provisions of US$3.05 billion.

"The downgrade of TD's BCA reflects the scale and severity of the bank's risk management failures as evidenced by its BSA/AML settlement with the Department of Justice and regulators, which has changed our view of the effectiveness of TD's governance" said Robert Colangelo, Moody's Ratings Vice President - Senior Credit Officer. "Next year will be a transitional year for the bank's US operations as it continues to invest in its US BSA/AML remediation program and undertakes its balance sheet restructuring to comply with the asset cap that was imposed on its US bank subsidiaries," Mr. Colangelo added.

A full list of affected ratings can be found at the end of this press release.

RATINGS RATIONALE

The ratings downgrade reflects the severity of TD's risk management failures, which are no longer consistent with an a1 BCA, and change our view of TD's long-established culture of low risk tolerance. TD and two US banking subsidiaries – TD Bank, N.A. and TD Bank USA, N.A. (collectively TD Bank US) – have consented to orders with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve Board, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), with the OCC imposing an asset cap on TD Bank US whereby the total assets of TD Bank US cannot exceed US$434 billion (total assets as of 30 September 2024). In addition, TD Bank, N.A. and its parent company TD Bank US Holding Company pled guilty to conspiring to fail to maintain an AML program that complies with the BSA, fail to file accurate Currency Transaction Reports, and launder money.

We regard TD's weaknesses in corporate governance and risk management as a governance risk under our General Principles for Assessing Environmental, Social and Governance Risks (ESG), given its implications for financial strategy and risk management, management credibility and track record, and compliance and reporting. We reflect such governance deficiencies in TD and TD GUS's high risk Governance Issuer Profile Score (G-4). As a result, we changed TD and TD GUS's ESG Credit Impact Score to CIS-4 from CIS-2, indicating that ESG considerations have a discernible impact on the current ratings. We have added a one-notch downward adjustment for corporate behavior into TD's rating construct.

While the financial penalties imposed on TD are largely covered by the provisions the bank has already booked, we expect that profitability will remain challenged over the medium term given the extensive US remediation program being implemented and the expected costs that will be incurred from the bank's strategy to comply with the asset cap that includes an asset reduction and investment portfolio repositioning. TD's remediation program will require ongoing monitoring of its progress through the appointment of a compliance monitor, which we believe will restrict the strategic and financial flexibility associated with its US activities. However, we expect these planned actions to provide capacity for T
